# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

This is a project repository where all of my HTML and CSS projects will go.

I have worked on 2 main projects:
1. One Page Website
2. Movie Theater Site

# One Page Website

On this project, I got to learn how to make my first webpage. I also followed an example on a Space Station Resort site. This uses a navbar to go to different parts of the site, a form in which could be filled out, and containers for images. It is all styled with CSS.

# Movie Theater Site

I never made a custom one of my own, but I did make an example page that turned out as expected. It is a movie site that was styled using Bootstrap. I used Bootstrap to form movie cards, dropdowns, jumbotrons, and a navbar to get around.
